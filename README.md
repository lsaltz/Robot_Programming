# Robot_Programming
My FIRST contributions Summer of 2018-May 2019.

Magnetar was programmed in Java during the Summer of 2018. Gravastar is The Highlander's official 2019 season bot.

VisionCamera is a part of a larger project, along with UPIDF, AutoSuite, TeleopSuite, OI, Robot, and AutoButton. To see the full project, please visit the official Highlanders (Team #4499) github.

AutoSuite, Robot, and OI were a collaboration with another programmer on The Highlanders.

The complete robot project can be found under the repository 2019-Gravastar.
